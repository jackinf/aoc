Blueprint 1:
  Each ore robot costs 4 ore.
  Each clay robot costs 2 ore.
  Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 14 clay.
  Each geode robot costs 2 ore and 7 obsidian.

which means that

geode robot costs 2 ore & 7 obsidian = 2 ore + 7 x (3 ore + 14 x 2 ore) = 219 ore

We reduce blueprint to
Blueprint 1:
  Each ore robot costs 4 ore.
  Each geode robot costs 219 ore.
